    <h1>React Hooks</h1>

    <p>Hooks allow you to get into the internal magic of React, which is more powerful and still reusable. Hooks are the
        future of React, though as we have seen the class based structure of React is still around. I was taught React
        Hooks in Rithm, and it is pretty damn similar.</p>

    <p>With Hooks, you write functional components rather than class based components.</p>

    <h2>useState</h2>

    <p>useState is a function that initializes our state, and returns to us first a variable to access the state, and
        second a
        function to change the state.</p>
