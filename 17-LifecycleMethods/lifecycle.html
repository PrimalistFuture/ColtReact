    <h1>React Lifecycle Methods</h1>

    <p>Built-in React methods for mounting, updating and unmounting and some less common methods.</p>

    <h2>Lifecycle</h2>

    <p>Every component comes with methods that allows devs to update application state and reflect the changes to the UI
        before/after key react events. </p>

    <p>The three main phases that a component goes through are mounting, updating and unmounting.</p>

    <p>When a component is told to be put on the page, React first runs the constructor, then the render(), which tells
        React what should be displayed. React updates the DOM to math the output of render(). Then componentDidMount()
        runs after,</p>

    <p>componentDidMount() is a a good place to load any data via AJAX or set up subscriptions/timers. </p>

    <h2>Loading Data via AJAX</h2>

    <p>Colt uses axios, <i>npm install axios</i></p>
