    <h1>React Lifecycle Methods</h1>

    <p>Built-in React methods for mounting, updating and unmounting and some less common methods.</p>

    <h2>Lifecycle</h2>

    <p>Every component comes with methods that allows devs to update application state and reflect the changes to the UI
        before/after key react events. </p>

    <p>The three main phases that a component goes through are mounting, updating and unmounting.</p>

    <p>When a component is told to be put on the page, React first runs the constructor, then the render(), which tells
        React what should be displayed. React updates the DOM to math the output of render(). Then componentDidMount()
        runs after,</p>

    <p>componentDidMount() is a a good place to load any data via AJAX or set up subscriptions/timers. </p>

    <h2>Loading Data via AJAX</h2>

    <p>Colt uses axios, <i>npm install axios</i>. As mentioned above, componentDidMount is where you should load data
        from AJAX, because that is what the React Docs recommend. There are some real reasons for this, but generally
        your component won't break if you don't but, but you should. They don't want you to load the async data in the
        constructor.
    </p>

    <p>Because we are loading our data after the component is loaded initially, we could concievably have a gap between
        that will not be a great experience for the user. Most React apps then will render a loading spinner so the user
        can see that the page is still loading.</p>

    <h2>Loading Data with Async Functions</h2>

    <p>CTD.</p>

    <h2>Introducing ComponentDidUpdate</h2>

    <p>Called everytime a component is updated, though not on mount. <b>This is the place to implement any side effect
            operations like</b> syncing up with localStorage, auto-saving, updating the DOM for uncontrolled components.
    </p>

    <p>Pass in the previous state and previous props into the componentDidUpdate. </p>

    <h2>Introducing ComponentWillUnmount</h2>

    <p>Called right before a compoenent is removed from a page. It should not set state, because there will be no
        re-rendering after this. This would be a good place to call clearInterval if you had a setTimeout running.
        Pretty straightforward.</p>
