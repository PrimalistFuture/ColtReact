    <h1>React Router Patterns</h1>

    <h2>Working with URL Params</h2>

    <p>Check the demo</p>

    <h2>Including a 404</h2>

    <p>The easiest way is to, at the end of your routes, have a Route that matches nothing, and renders a NotFound
        component. Order matters here.</p>

    <h2>Simple Search Form</h2>

    <p>Check demo2</p>

    <h2>Client-side Redirects</h2>

    <p>Check demo2</p>

    <p>React Router can mimic the behavior of server-side redirects. Thi is useful after certain actions like submitting
        a form. Can also be used instead of a 404 component.</p>

    <ul>Two main ways to redirect:
        <li>Using the Redirect component, which is generally used for stuff like "you shouldn't have gotten here, go
            here instead."</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
