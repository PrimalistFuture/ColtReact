    <h1>Color Project Notes</h1>

    <h2>New Technologies</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Material UI - very popular library for React components that combine CSS and JavaScript.</li>

        <li>Chroma.js - library for interacting with colors, including the rgba and hexa colors. Used also for chaning
            the color saturation.</li>

        <li>Emoji-Mart - library for picking emojis</li>

        <li>React Sortable HOC - simple way of implementing drag and drop in our color palatte.</li>

        <li>React Copy-to-Clipboard - does what the title suggests.</li>

        <li>React PureComponent - built-in to react that prevents unnecessisary component re-renders</li>

        <li>React-Form-Validator-Core - validators to help us ensure that the users color palette names are valid and
            not duplicates </li>

        <li>React-transition-group - will help us transition between our various routes.</li>

        <li>JSS - Write JavaScript to describe our styles. Will be in .js files.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Installation Issues</h2>

    <p>One problem I've had with this course is that lots of the tech used is older, and there have since been newer
        versions that are very similar but note the same. So following along with Colt has been identical 95% of the
        time, but very difficult the other 5%. </p>

    <p>I would like to dodge this issue by cloning his initial commit and installing the dependencies from that time.
