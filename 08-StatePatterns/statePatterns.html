    <h1>React State Patterns</h1>

    <ul>Goals
        <li>Learn how to update state based off of existing state</li>
        <li>Properly manage state updates for mutable data structures</li>
        <li>Discuss best practices for modeling state and designing components</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Updating Existing State</h2>

    <p>Thus far we have changed state, like from true to false or from 1 to 6, but we haven't updated the state based
        off of existing state.
    </p>

    <p>Remember that setState is asynchronous, so it is risky to assume that the previous call of setState has entirely
        finished when you call it. Also React will sometimes batch (squash together) calls to setState for performance
        reasons.</p>

    <p><b>If a call to setState depends on the current state, the safest thing is to use the alternate "callback
            form".</b> setState can accept a callback function rather that an object. This callback should have the
        current state as a parameter, and it should return an object representing the new state.</p>

    <p>The fact that you can pass a function to this.setState lends itself nicely to a more advanced pattern called
        functional setState. You can describe your state updates abstractly as seperate functions. This makes the code
        more readable, easier to test and is a common pattern with Redux.
    </p>

    <h2>Mutating State the safe way</h2>

    <p>So far everything we have stored in state has been a primative value - strings, numbers, booleans. But component
        state also commonly includes objects, arrays and nested data structures. But mutating nested data structures in
        your state can cause problems with React. </p>

    <p>A much better way is to make a new copy of the data structure in question. We can use any <b>pure</b> function to
        do this. We then update the copy and set the state with that copy. This means that .map, .filter, .reduce are
        your friends. So is the ...spread operator.</p>
