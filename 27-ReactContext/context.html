    <h1>React Context</h1>

    <p>In a typical React app, data is passed top-down via props, but this is cumbersome for certain types of props that
        are required by many components within an application. Context provides a way to share values between components
        without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.</p>

    <p>Context is designed to share data that can be considered 'global' for a tree of React components, such as the
        current authenticated user, them or preferred language.</p>

    <p>Context can also be used (with some help from useReducer) to solve the issue we saw in the last section, in which
        some of our hooks were passed through multiple components, in which they were not ever used, and finally used
        way down the chain. Its an organizational issue. You are going to see that component recieve a prop and imagine
        it is important for that component, when in fact it is just passing through.</p>

    <p>There are some conflicting ideas about if context should be used to solve the above issue.</p>

    <h2>Material UI</h2>

    <p>So many of the videos in this section have to do with working with Material UI and very little to do with
        Context. I skimmed over them.</p>

    <h2>Context and Providers</h2>

    <p>Every Context object comes with a Provider React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to
        context changes. </p>

    <p>So Context is </p>
