    <h1>React Props</h1>

    <h2>Intro</h2>

    <p><b>Properties or Props</b> allow us to make a component more customizable and more reusable. Props are how we
        pass data from one component to another, from a parent to a child.</p>

    <p>Data is passed into a component like you would specific a attribute in HTML propertyName="Whatever".</p>

    <p>From there, the component must know how to handle the data passed into it, otherwise nothing happens.</p>

    <p>One crucial point about props is that they are immutable - they cannot be changed, altered or add to it; they are
        read only. Data can of course be changed, but that is not done with props, that should be done with State.</p>

    <p>The data passed into a component as a prop can be of any type, but strings should be double quoted and all other
        types need to be surrounded with curly brackets.</p>

    <h2>Exercise</h2>

    <p>I mostly got it except I forgot to return this shit. Whoops.</p>

    <h2>Looping in JSX</h2>

    <p>The most common way to loop in JSX is with array.map() to output loops in JSX.</p>
