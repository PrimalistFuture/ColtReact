    <h1>React Props</h1>

    <h2>Intro</h2>

    <p><b>Properties or Props</b> allow us to make a component more customizable and more reusable. Props are how we
        pass data from one component to another, from a parent to a child.</p>

    <p>Data is passed into a component like you would specific a attribute in HTML propertyName="Whatever".</p>

    <p>From there, the component must know how to handle the data passed into it, otherwise nothing happens.</p>

    <p>One crucial point about props is that they are immutable - they cannot be changed, altered or add to it; they are
        read only. Data can of course be changed, but that is not done with props, that should be done with State.</p>

    <p>The data passed into a component as a prop can be of any type, but strings should be double quoted and all other
        types need to be surrounded with curly brackets.</p>

    <h2>Exercise</h2>

    <p>I mostly got it except I forgot to return this shit. Whoops.</p>

    <h2>Looping in JSX</h2>

    <p>The most common way to loop in JSX is with array.map() to output loops in JSX.</p>

    <h2>Default Values for Props</h2>

    <p>In the component that we want to use a default prop in, we can make an object called defaultProps - which is
        magic and needs to be called this - and define the props like we would any other object from there.</p>

    <h2>Styling React</h2>

    <p>Generally when styling React components, the .css file will have the same name as the component it is stying and
        it will only govern the styling of that component and nothing else.</p>

    <p>Generally that component will have a class in a div of the name of the component. But instead of calling it class
        like you would in normal css and html, call it className.</p>

    <p>Additionally, when styling with a label attribute, "for" is reserved and must now be "htmlFor" instead.</p>

    <p>We can instead of a dedicated .css file style in-line as well. This will be done with a "style" attribute and
        then we can pass in some javascript with {}.</p>
