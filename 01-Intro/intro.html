    <h1>React Intro</h1>

    <p>A lot of this early stuff should be review for me. But we will see.</p>

    <h2>React</h2>

    <p>The main idea of React is to make components, that encapsulate logic and HTML in a class, which makes it easier
        to build modular applications.</p>

    <p>In general, you want your JS, CSS, and HTML to all be seperate. React does this in a slightly different way,
        where each component has those three parts, but combined into one piece. </p>

    <h2>Front End Frameworks</h2>

    <p>A <b>library</b> is some code that can be incorporated into your code. As opposed to a <b>framework</b> which is
        some code that you can use to build your own code. Frameworks are opinionated, they want things done their way -
        like files need to be in a certain spot and named a certain way. </p>

    <p>There are many popular front end frameworks, like angular, ember, and vue. Angular and the like come with a lot
        of features out of the box, like testing, a client router, command line interface and tons more.</p>

    <p>React refers to itself as a library. The vanilla version is far less feature rich than something like Angular.
        However there are bunch of tools that near standards like React Router, Webpack, Redux and more, which pushes
        the React development pattern towards the framework end.</p>

    <h2>Components</h2>

    <p>Components are the building blocks of react. Components let you split the UI into indepenent, reusable pieces,
        and think about each piece in isolation. Conceptually, components are like JS functions. They accept arbitary
        inputs, called props, and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.</p>

    <p>They can be very small, just a single button, or quite large. But they are meant to be modular and reusable.</p>

    <h2>Setting up a Server</h2>

    <p>If we want our files to be served up from localhost, we have to do some stuff first. Colt has an extension called
        live server in vscode. After installing, we can right click on a file to open it with the live server.</p>

    <h2>First Component</h2>

    <p>I downloaded some starter files from colt and put them in this folder. They must be started up with the live
        server, the babel script will not like it if we open it via the file protocol.</p>

    <p>This behaves now like standard HTML. Except React has a few quirks. When we return something from the Render
        method, like a div or an h1, we can only have one top level element. That element can contain other elements,
        but it must not have any top level siblings.</p>
