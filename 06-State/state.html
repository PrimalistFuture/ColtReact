    <h1>State Intro</h1>

    <p>Critical to making apps where you want things to change. <b>State</b> exists in every User Interface, where some
        information has to be tracked as it might be changing. Examples: logged-in users see a different screen than
        logged-out users; Clicking "edit profile" opens up a modal (pop-up) window; sections of a website can expand or
        collapse like a "read more" section.</p>

    <p>State is different from props in that it can change (whereas props are immutable) and that state is usually
        specific to the component, rather than passed down like a prop normally is.</p>

    <p>The state of the client interface (front-end) may or may not be directly tied to the state of the server
        (back-end). </p>

    <p>State tracks UI logic and business logic. With vanilla JS, we would use the DOM as the source of truth for the
        state: we would select some element from the DOM and check to see its value or position or whatever. With React,
        it is the opposite.</p>

    <h2>Initializing State</h2>

    <p>In React, State is an instance attribute on a component. It is a object since you will want to keep track of
        several key/values. It must be called State, the name is magic.</p>

    <p>State should be initialized as soon as the component is created in a constructor function. If your component is
        stateless, you can omit the constructor as we have done up to this point. </p>

    <p>CTD: The constructor takes one argument: props, and you must call super(props) at the start of the constructor,
        which "registers" your class as a React Component. If your component is stateless, we don't need to call
        super(props) but otherwise it should always been done, and it is safe do do it even if the component is dumb.
    </p>
