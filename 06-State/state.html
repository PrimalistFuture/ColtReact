    <h1>State Intro</h1>

    <p>Critical to making apps where you want things to change. <b>State</b> exists in every User Interface, where some
        information has to be tracked as it might be changing. Examples: logged-in users see a different screen than
        logged-out users; Clicking "edit profile" opens up a modal (pop-up) window; sections of a website can expand or
        collapse like a "read more" section.</p>

    <p>State is different from props in that it can change (whereas props are immutable) and that state is usually
        specific to the component, rather than passed down like a prop normally is.</p>

    <p>The state of the client interface (front-end) may or may not be directly tied to the state of the server
        (back-end). </p>

    <p>State tracks UI logic and business logic. With vanilla JS, we would use the DOM as the source of truth for the
        state: we would select some element from the DOM and check to see its value or position or whatever. With React,
        it is the opposite.</p>

    <h2>Initializing State</h2>

    <p>In React, State is an instance attribute on a component. It is a object since you will want to keep track of
        several key/values. It must be called State, the name is magic.</p>

    <p>State should be initialized as soon as the component is created in a constructor function. If your component is
        stateless, you can omit the constructor as we have done up to this point. </p>

    <p>CTD: The constructor takes one argument: props, and you must call super(props) at the start of the constructor,
        which "registers" your class as a React Component. If your component is stateless, we don't need to call
        super(props) but otherwise it should always been done, and it is safe do do it even if the component is dumb.
    </p>

    <h2>Setting State Correctly</h2>

    <p>Unlike props, state can be reassigned, but it should NEVER be directly manipulated like you would any other
        object (<i>this.state.score = 0</i>). Instead, React really wants you to use <b>this.setState(), which is a
            built-in React method of changing a component's state.</b>
    </p>

    <p>this.setState() should not be called in the constructor (why you would want to after you just initialized it I
        have no idea) or in the render().
    </p>

    <p>this.setState() takes an object describing the state changes, and it <b>patches</b> state object - keys that you
        didn't specify don't change. This is done so that the state keys you don't want to change don't go away. This
        all happens asynchronously - the component's state will eventually update. React controls when the state will
        change, for performance reasons. This is important because when a components state changes, it triggers a that
        component to re-render.
    </p>

    <p>Check the demo to see how to change state, but we will see a better way later to actually do the rest of it.</p>

    <h2>React Events</h2>

    <p>Most of the time when you want the state to change is because of some sort of user event.</p>
    <p>In React, every JSX element has built in attributes representing every kind of browser event. They are all
        camelCased, like onClick, and take callback functions as event listeners. These functions should be passed in,
        but not executed with (). The event listener will handle the execution.</p>

    <p>Make sure to bind the handleClick function (conventionally called this) in the constructor!!!! CTD. There are
        other ways to bind functions, but this is fine.</p>

    <h2>State Exercise</h2>

    <p>Pretty standard from the demo's examples. But has some examples of conditional logical short curcuiting. We also
        could have added another piece of state isWinner that we would set if the number is 7.</p>

    <h2>State as Props</h2>

    <p>A very common React pattern is a stateful ('smart') parent component passing down its state values as props to
        stateless ('dumb') child components. This idea is generalized in React as "downward data flow". It means that
        components get simpler as you go down the component heirarchy and parents tend to be more stateful than their
        children.</p>
