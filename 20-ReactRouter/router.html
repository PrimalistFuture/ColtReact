    <h1>React Router</h1>

    <ul>Goals
        <li>Describe what client-side routing is and why it's useful</li>
        <li>Compare client-side routing to server-side routing</li>
        <li>Implement client-side routing with React Router</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Server-Side Routing</h2>

    <p>Traditional routing is server-side. Clicking a link causes browser to request a new page and replace the entire
        DOM. The Server decides what HTML to return based on URL requested and the entire page refreshes. The
        information from the old page is totally gone and no trace of it will be on the new page.</p>

    <h2>Fake Client-Side Routing</h2>

    <p>Client-side routing handles mapping between URL bar and the content a user sees via browser rather than via
        server.</p>

    <p>Client-side routing essentially fakes traditional server-side routing. All of your data exists within the page
        already, but browser will only show what you want it to. When a link is clicked it won't take you to a new page,
        but a it will refresh with the new content.</p>

    <p>Issues: The browser doesn't really know that things have changed, and the forward and back buttons don't work. We
        don't
        get URLs that would let a user navigate directly do a page. And the user can't bookmark specific pages.</p>

    <p>Sites that exclusively use client-side routing are called <b>single-page applications</b>. They use JavaScript to
        manipulate the URL bar with a Web API called History</p>

    <p>It works, but its just okay.</p>

    <h2>React Router and real client-side routing</h2>

    <p>There are many tools you can use to make client-side routing, and React Router is one such tool. It is not built
        into React, or really even an offical add-on. But it is very popular.</p>

    <p>To install, <b>npm install react-router-dom</b>. It must be imported at the top, <b>import {BrowserRouter} from
            "react-router-dom";</b>. There are other types of routers you can look into, but this one is fine.</p>
