    <h1>React Router</h1>

    <ul>Goals
        <li>Describe what client-side routing is and why it's useful</li>
        <li>Compare client-side routing to server-side routing</li>
        <li>Implement client-side routing with React Router</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Server-Side Routing</h2>

    <p>Traditional routing is server-side. Clicking a link causes browser to request a new page and replace the entire
        DOM. The Server decides what HTML to return based on URL requested and the entire page refreshes. The
        information from the old page is totally gone and no trace of it will be on the new page.</p>

    <h2>Fake Client-Side Routing</h2>

    <p>Client-side routing handles mapping between URL bar and the content a user sees via browser rather than via
        server.</p>

    <p>Client-side routing essentially fakes traditional server-side routing. All of your data exists within the page
        already, but browser will only show what you want it to. When a link is clicked it won't take you to a new page,
        but a it will refresh with the new content.</p>

    <p>Issues: The browser doesn't really know that things have changed, and the forward and back buttons don't work. We
        don't
        get URLs that would let a user navigate directly do a page. And the user can't bookmark specific pages.</p>

    <p>Sites that exclusively use client-side routing are called <b>single-page applications</b>. They use JavaScript to
        manipulate the URL bar with a Web API called History</p>

    <p>It works, but its just okay.</p>

    <h2>React Router and real client-side routing</h2>

    <p>There are many tools you can use to make client-side routing, and React Router is one such tool. It is not built
        into React, or really even an offical add-on. But it is very popular.</p>

    <p>To install, <b>npm install react-router-dom</b>. It must be imported at the top, <b>import {BrowserRouter} from
            "react-router-dom";</b>. There are other types of routers you can look into, but this one is fine.</p>

    <p>By default, Route matching in React Router is inclusive - it wants to match as many routes as possible. For that
        reason, put your more general routes (like your root route 'localhost:3000/') at the bottom. </p>

    <p>The Switch import from react-router-dom will make sure that you only get one match, but it still needs you to put
        the more general ones at the bottom, because every route will match with your root ('/')</p>

    <p>Another solution to the order mattering issue the <b>exact prop</b> that can be passed into a path. Now
        ReactRouter will only route to an exact match and order won't matter anymore. As a general rule, all of your
        routes should have the exact prop unless you have a reason not to.</p>

    <h2>Intro to Link Component</h2>

    <p>The Link component acts as a replacement for the anchor tag (a). Instead of an href, we use a prop called 'to'.
        And instead of making a GET request to another page, JS intercepts the click and does client-side routing.</p>

    <h2>NavLinks</h2>

    <p>NavLink component works just like the link component, but if we are at a page the link would go to, the component
        gets a CSS class of active. This lets you stylize links to page you are already at using the <b>activeStyle or
            activeClassName props.</b> </p>

    <h2>Render props vs Component props</h2>

    <p>Check out the demo for a quick discussion of some of the differences between render and component as a prop in
        our Routes. If we are passing props, it is better to user render, otherwise component.</p>
