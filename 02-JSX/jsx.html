    <h1>JSX</h1>

    <h2>Basics</h2>

    <p><b>JavaScript Syntax Extension</b> is a way of writing HTML looking code in JavaScript, which would normally be
        totally invalid. This lets us write components and easily see what it directly results in. Behind the scenes
        Babel is 'transpiling' the HTML into valid JS. But we don't have to worry about that. </p>

    <p>It is possible to write React code without JSX, but it is a lot harder and a lot uglier.</p>

    <p>JSX is more strict that HTML - elements must either have an explicit closing tag <i>b ... /b</i>, or be
        explicitly self closing <i>input name='msg' /.</i> You cannot leave off the / or you will get a syntax error.
    </p>

    <p>And remember that you can only have a single top level element.</p>

    <h2>Embedding JS in JSX</h2>

    <p>In JSX, things we surround with curly braces can be normal, vanilla JS. When we have a bunch of different
        components all talking to each other, this will let us create more dynamic code. Check the demo, we will be
        doing it all of the time.</p>

    <h2>Conditionals in JSX</h2>

    <p>Displaying things selectively in JSX is a little stranger than you might expect. There are a bunch of ways of
        doing it, but there are something you will have to avoid as well. </p>

    <p>The simplest and most common way to have conditional logic in JSX is to use the ternary operator.</p>

    <h2>Standard React App Layout</h2>

    <p>Nothing we have done some far is the standard React App Layout. Typically you have a top level App component. And
        you typically only have one component per file. The App component will combine all of the other components we
        want and it will have the final say. Usually this is the only thing rendered in the DOM.</p>

    <p>Make sure the smaller components are included as scripts before the component that might render them.</p>
