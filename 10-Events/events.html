    <h1>React Events</h1>

    <h2>Commonly Used React Events</h2>

    <p>You can attach event handlers to HTML elements in React via special reserved attributes like onClick. You can do
        this in vanilla JavaScript too but the syntax is a bit different.</p>

    <p>Some common ones: <b>onClick, onMouseOver, onSubmit, onKeyDown, onKeyUp, onKeyPress</b>. There are a ton.</p>

    <h2>Method Binding</h2>

    <p>We must bind a method because the keyword <b>this</b> loses context within our event handlers - they aren't sure
        what this is. We already saw one way of binding a method in the constructor - which should be considered the
        default. But there are more.</p>

    <p><b>Inline</b> can be done within the event attribute. It is very explicit, but if that event handler function is
        part of multiple components, it must be bound every time. This means that a 'new' function is created on every
        render. Mostly these are small points, but they could matter.</p>

    <p>It can also be done inline with an arrow function - syntax is a little different</p>

    <p>There is another 'experimental' way of binding that works fine in React because of Babel, but it is not in real
        JavaScript yet. Colt has a video on it.</p>

    <h2>Method Binding with Arguments</h2>

    <p>So far the examples we have seen did not have any arguments passed into the event handler.</p>

    <h2>Passing functions to child components</h2>

    <p>A very common pattern in react is passing down functions to child components. The idea is that child components
        are often not stateful, but still need to tell the parernts to change the state.</p>

    <p>So the parent component defines a function, the function is passed as a prop to the child component, the child
        component invokes the prop, the parent function is called, usually setting a new state, and finally the parent
        component is re-rendered along with its children.</p>

    <p>CTD. This is complicated.</p>

    <p>In general, it is always better to bind as high up as you can. Don't bind in the child component if you can get
        away with it. If you need a parameter, pass it down to the child as a prop, then bind in parent and child. Avoid
        inline arrow function / binding if possible.</p>

    <p>Don't worry about performance first, get it all working then can refactor if needed.</p>

    <h2>Parent / Child naming conventions</h2>

    <p>You can of course call these handlers whatever you want, React doesn't care. But for consistency, try to follow
        the 'action' / 'handleAction' pattern.</p>

    <h2>React Keys</h2>

    <p>Anytime you map over some data and return a list, you will get a warning that the items in the list should have a
        'key' prop. The key is a special string attribute to include when creating lists of elements. These keys need to
        be unique so that React can be track of what has changed / removed. Usually this can come from your own data
        set, or database. </p>

    <p>The last resort is to use the index of the item in the array. Only works if your data is not going to change.</p>

    <p>Can also install uuid or shortid or some other tool that will generate a unique id for you.</p>
