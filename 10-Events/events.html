    <h1>React Events</h1>

    <h2>Commonly Used React Events</h2>

    <p>You can attach event handlers to HTML elements in React via special reserved attributes like onClick. You can do
        this in vanilla JavaScript too but the syntax is a bit different.</p>

    <p>Some common ones: <b>onClick, onMouseOver, onSubmit, onKeyDown, onKeyUp, onKeyPress</b>. There are a ton.</p>

    <h2>Method Binding</h2>

    <p>We must bind a method because the keyword <b>this</b> loses context within our event handlers - they aren't sure
        what this is. We already saw one way of binding a method in the constructor - which should be considered the
        default. But there are more.</p>

    <p><b>Inline</b> can be done within the event attribute. It is very explicit, but if that event handler function is
        part of multiple components, it must be bound every time. This means that a 'new' function is created on every
        render. Mostly these are small points, but they could matter.</p>

    <p>It can also be done inline with an arrow function - syntax is a little different</p>

    <p>There is another 'experimental' way of binding that works fine in React because of Babel, but it is not in real
        JavaScript yet. Colt has a video on it.</p>

    <h2>Method Binding with Arguments</h2>

    <p>So far the examples we have seen did not have any arguments passed into the event handler.</p>
