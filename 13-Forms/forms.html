    <h1>React Forms</h1>

    <p>Forms work a little different than they do in vanilla HTML. Forms in React naturally keep some internal state, so
        that you can access information from the inputs.</p>

    <p>So it is convenient to have a JS function that handles the submission of the form and has access to the data the
        user entered. The technique to get this is called a <b>controlled component</b>. React really wants to override
        the vanilla HTML such that React has control over the form and syncs the state up. React controls what is shown
        in the component and what happens when the user types (which gets kept in state).
    </p>

    <p>This way there is no gap of knowledge between React state and the form input - React state is the source of
        truth. With a controlled component, every state mutation will have an associated handler function. This makes it
        easy to modify or validate user input.</p>

    <h2>Multiple Input Forms</h2>

    <p>Of course we could make a new handleChange function for each input of the form, but that is a lot of new code
        that only changes the state. The issue with this is how do we write a handleChange function that knows which
        piece of state to update? CTD.</p>

    <h2>Passing Data Upwards to a parent component</h2>

    <p>In React we generally have a downward data flow in which "smart" parent components pass state and other data down
        as props to a child component.</p>

    <p>But forms require a lot of information and state</p>

    <h2>Using UUID for Unique Keys</h2>

    <p>Sometimes there isn't a great natural id to use for the key prop that React needs to keep arrays and whatnot
        ordered correctly. In that scenario, one option is to install uuid, a library that will generate a universally
        unique id for you. Install with <i>npm install uuid</i></p>
